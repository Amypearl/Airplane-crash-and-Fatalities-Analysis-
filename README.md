# Airplane-crash-and-Fatalities-Analysis-
ABSTRACT

Being involved in an airplane accident is a nightmare scenario for any air traveler, crew and pilot. Statistically air travel is among the safest means of transport, but at the same time it is also associated with sporadic accidents that have proven to be extremely terrifying ordeals for all involved due to vast array of reasons. The causes of these accidents are of varying nature and depend on some problems that are originated during some stage of the flight process; which includes structural failure, weather, engine, pilot error amongst others.

Introduction

An aviation accident is defined by the convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13 as occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft, which takes place from the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until all such persons have disembarked and in which

a) A person is fatally or seriously injured

b) The aircraft sustains significant damage or structural failure

c) The aircraft goes missing or completely inaccessible

Problem Study:

This dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.

Task

Tell a visual story from this Data and let us notice what we wouldn't have without your work

Tools used for the Analysis

Microsoft Excel: Used in evaluating the data

Microsoft PowerBI: Used in visualization

Data cleaning and processing

Excel was used to load and clean the data, ensuring that it is correct, relevant and completely free of error and outlier when performing analysis:

Explore and observe data

Checked for duplicates

Changed data type.

Added custom column (using "if text contains" function) To derive the cause of fatalities and splitted them into categories

Extracted year from the date using date function

Extracted countries using power query (text after delimeter function).

Exploratory Data Analysis

Imported the dataset into PowerBI, using power query and made some modifications

Added year and month column

Replaced null values

Created a new measure column for survivors


Conclusion

This analysis shows that airplane crash and fatalities are mostly caused by structural failure and weather.

Nonetheless all airlines should painstakingly adhere to published safety recommendation rules by the different aviation controlling bodies to curb or possibly eradicate air related accidents in the world.
